\maketitle

In recent times, it has become increasingly clear to most people that climate change is affecting life on Earth. As temperatures rise globally, many animals are forced to adapt to their environment \cite{parmesan2007pheno,gaughan2009domestic,root2003fingerprints}. Among the best-documented instances of such adaptation are changes in bird migration times \cite{miller2008bird,visser2008climate,jenni2003timing}. This paper presents an interactive visualization with the goal to communicate these findings.

\subsection{Problem Description}

Despite evidence presented in numerous studies \cite{solomon2007climate,parry2007climate}, it has proved to be difficult to communicate the effects of climate change to people \cite{lee2015predictors,brulle2012shifting,moser2011communicating}. We believe that visualizing effects that can be observed in everyday life is an important way of fostering public engagement. One such effect is the change in the time of the year during which migratory birds can be observed in their breeding habitat. As global temperatures increased, birds have been migrating to their breeding habitats earlier in the year \cite{cotton2003avian,huppop2003north,marra2005influence}. Using a visual approach, we intend to show this correlation in a way that is interpretable to experts and non-experts alike.

Both bird migration and surface temperature changes are cyclic processes with an annual period. In order to infer trends in these processes, we should consider data from multiple years, or even decades. However, because of the cyclic nature, it is difficult to directly compare one year to another. One of the challenges of this problem is to visualize trends over the long term, without obscuring the patterns that occur every year.

Another attribute that these processes have in common is that they are both geographic. That is, both produce data that is associated with a particular place on Earth \cite{iso2014geo}. It is essential to visualize both in such a way that one does not obscure the other, while their correlation is still visible.

\section{Data Analysis}

\subsection{Domain Data Specification}

In order to visualize the problem, we need two different datasets: one that includes information about birds migration and one including temperature changes over the years.

For the first needed dataset we have chosen the eBird Basic Dataset \cite{ebird2020data}. The eBird citizen science project is unmatched in scale, containing over 600 million observations, including nearly every bird species on Earth \cite{strimas2020ebird}. Submissions are individually reviewed to ensure accuracy of information. As people are contributing to this dataset continuously, the information inside is up-to-date, but the record also goes many years back.

For the second, we have chosen the GISTEMP dataset \cite{gistemp} by NASA, which provides the temperature data from 1880 up to 2020 in a regular 2° by 2° grid. The main advantage of this dataset compared to other temperature datasets we found is that this one uses the temperature anomalies. These anomalies are relative to a 30-year period between 1951 and 1980. By using anomalies instead of absolute values \cite{gistempanomalies}, it is easier to see how much colder or warmer a certain place is. 

\subsection{Data Abstraction: What}

The eBird Basic Dataset \cite{ebird2020data} consists of a large static table containing items that each correspond to a particular observation of a bird or a group of birds. For each observation, a number of attributes are provided, though we are only interested in the following subset:

\paragraph{Species} A categorical attribute represented by the scientific name, e.g. \textit{Anas platyrhynchos}. The eBird taxonomy\cite{ebird2019taxonomy} specifies exactly what is meant with these names.

\paragraph{Date} An ordered, quantitative and diverging attribute in year-month-day format (yyyy-mm-dd).

\paragraph{Location} A spatial attribute consisting of a vector with components latitude and longitude. Each component is itself an ordered, quantitive and cyclic attribute represented as decimal degrees, where positive values denote N/W and negative values denote S/E for latitude/longitude respectively. The precision varies between observations, but is typically 0.001 degrees or more precise (which is less than 1 km on Earth's surface).

\paragraph{Count} An ordered, quantitative and diverging attribute represented as an integer. Since participants are allowed to group multiple birds in a single observation, the value can be 1 or greater.

\vspace{2mm}

We perform a number of transformations on the original dataset for the purpose of our visualization. First, we limit ourselves to a single species, since different species exhibit significantly different migratory behavior. We chose the Barn Swallow (\textit{Hirundo rustica}) because it is a relatively common migratory bird, and it typically migrates over a large distance \cite{turner1989swallow}. Next, we restrict the dataset geographically to Europe and Africa. These transformations allow us to focus on a general population of birds. Finally, we exclude observations outside the years 1950-2020, since that matches the domain of the temperature dataset we use.

\vspace{2mm}

The GISTEMP dataset \cite{gistemp} consists of a large static multidimensional scalar field, whose dimensions are the latitude, the longitude and the date. For each point in space-time, a temperature anomaly value is available. The description of each dimension and the value:

\paragraph{Latitude} An ordered quantitative cyclic attribute represented as decimal degrees, varying from -90.0 to 90.0.

\paragraph{Longitude} An ordered quantitative cyclic attribute represented as decimal degrees, varying from -180.0 to 180.0.

\paragraph{Temperature Anomaly} A quantitive attribute represented in degrees Celcius.

\paragraph{Date} An ordered, quantitive and diverging attribute in year-month format (yyyy-month).

\section{Task Analysis}

\subsection{Domain Specific Tasks}

% In this section, you must analyze the possible visualization tasks that an expert in the chosen domain would be interested in. Ideally, you would present a set of tasks and questions that are intimately related to the chosen domain.

\subsection{Task Abstraction: Why}

% Once you have defined a set of domain specific tasks, you must generalize them to be domain independent to be able to use the principles from visualization. In this sense, we propose you follow the principles described in Munzner's book \cite{munzner2014visualization} and described in the lectures.

\section{Visualization and Interaction Design: How}

% Describe and motivate your choices for the visual encodings and interaction design (\emph{How}). You should not think about implementation yet, but rather what visual encodings fit best to address the task/data results presented earlier. You must justify your choices based on the design principles described in the course. Here is where you explicitly link your tasks, questions and data to the design, and argue why the chosen design will enable users to perform the tasks and answer their questions. Explain the main interactions provided in your solution.

\section{Realization}

% After you have a visualization design, you should elaborate on what you have implemented and what compromises were made. For instance, your ideal solution may consider edge bundling \cite{holten2006hierarchical} but you could not implement it in your final solution. In this section, you should also mention what framework/technology you used for your implementation and justify why you chose it.

\section{Use Cases}

% Describe the analysis of the data and how your application was used to perform the analysis. Here you demonstrate how to use your application to perform the tasks and answer the questions as an evaluation of your design and implementation.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

% Finally, you will reflect on what you have achieved. For instance, this section should discuss whether you managed to do what you initially planned, whether your initial choices worked well or not, things that you discovered that were not correct, etc. Conclusions about your whole work would be provided.
